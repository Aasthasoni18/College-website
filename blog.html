            <h2>Our Certificates & Programs</h2>
            <p>A sixth form college or college of further education is an educational institution in England,
                 Wales, Northern Ireland, Belize, the Caribbean, Malta, Norway, Brunei, or Southern Africa,
                among others, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications,
                 such as A-levels, BTEC, HND or its equivalent and the International Baccalaureate Diploma,
                 or school-level qualifications such as GCSEs. In Singapore and India, this is known as a junior college. 
                 The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase "sixth form college" as the English name for a lyc√©e.</p>

                 <p>In some national education systems, secondary schools may be called "colleges" or have "college" as part of their title.
                    In Australia the term "college" is applied to any private or independent (non-government) primary and, especially,
                 secondary school as distinct from a state school. Melbourne Grammar School, Cranbrook School, Sydney and The King's School,
                  Parramatta are considered colleges.</p>

                  <p>In a number of Canadian cities, many government-run secondary schools are called "collegiates" or "collegiate institutes" (C.I.),
                     a complicated form of the word "college" which avoids the usual "post-secondary" connotation. This is because these secondary 
                     schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational, subjects and ability levels (for example, collegiates 
                     offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses). Some private secondary schools (such as Upper Canada College,
                      Vancouver College) choose to use the word "college" in their names nevertheless.[9] Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, 
                      particularly ones within the separate school system, may also use the word "college" or "collegiate" in their names.</p>
